# Dynamic Parking Pricing System
*Capstone Project - Summer Analytics 2025*

## 🚀 Project Overview

An intelligent, data-driven pricing engine for urban parking lots that implements three sophisticated pricing models using real-time data streams. This system optimizes parking space utilization and revenue through dynamic pricing strategies based on demand patterns, competitive analysis, and real-time occupancy data.

## 📊 Features

- **Three Pricing Models**: 
  - Linear pricing based on occupancy rates
  - Demand-based dynamic pricing with surge capabilities
  - Competitive pricing with market intelligence
- **Real-Time Processing**: Pathway integration for streaming data analysis
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Comprehensive analysis dashboards with Bokeh
- **Rerouting Intelligence**: Smart suggestions for optimal parking locations
- **Data Analytics**: Historical trend analysis and predictive modeling

## 🛠 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-parking-pricing.git

## 🔧 Configuration

The system can be configured through the `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "pricing_models": {
    "linear": {"enabled": true, "base_rate": 2.0},
    "demand_based": {"enabled": true, "surge_multiplier": 1.5},
    "competitive": {"enabled": true, "market_factor": 0.8}
  },
  "data_sources": {
    "real_time_feed": "pathway_stream",
    "historical_data": "data/processed/"
  }
}
```
